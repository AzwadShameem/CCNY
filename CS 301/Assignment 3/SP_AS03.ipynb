    "$10^{-8}$ The number of iterations seems correct because the error estimate must be within the error\n",
    "bound, basically the only number the tolerance accepts is less than $10^{-8}$.\n",
    "Furthermore, it is to be noted that the actual absolute error is not within the error bound\n",
    "because the absolute error is 3.674879558435151e-07 which is a number clearly above the tolerance\n",
